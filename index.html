            <h2>why is diddy in jail</h2>
            <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs is in jail serving a 50-month (over 4 years) federal prison sentence after being convicted in October 2025 of two counts of transportation for prostitution under the Mann Act, related to flying women across state lines for sex acts, though he was acquitted of more serious sex trafficking and racketeering charges. This followed numerous civil lawsuits accusing him of sexual assault, abuse, and trafficking, which he denied, but his conviction stemmed from testimony in his criminal trial about his use of power, drugs, and intimidation to exploit victims. 
Key Details of His Conviction:
Charges: Found guilty of transporting people for prostitution (violating the Mann Act).
Acquitted Of: Racketeering and sex trafficking.
Sentence: 50 months in prison, a $500,000 fine, and supervised release.
Trial Basis: The conviction was based on evidence from his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura and another accuser ("Jane") detailing forced sexual encounters and "Freak Offs". 
Background:
Combs faced multiple civil lawsuits alleging sexual assault, abuse, and trafficking, some dating back decades.
His federal case in New York involved testimony about his control over victims through drugs, financial support, and threats.
While denying allegations, he expressed remorse at his sentencing, acknowledging his "downfall" and "selfishness," notes the BBC.
He is currently appealing the conviction, according to ABC News.</p>
